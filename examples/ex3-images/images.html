    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>
      HTML pages are in fact containers of different elements, which can be
      included in the page. External elements should be supported by the
      browsers in order to be rendered correctly - that is, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type"
        >Media (or MIME) type</a
      >
      of the file should be supported.
    </p>

    <p>As for images, all modern browsers generally supports:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JPEG or JPG</li>
      <li>GIF</li>
      <li>PNG</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There is also the possibility to use
      <a href="./svg-image.html">SVG</a> files. Contrary to the formats listed
      above, SVG are
      <a href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/fr/Image_vectorielle"
        >vector images</a
      >
      (i.e. computed mathematically), whereas the other are
      <a href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/fr/Image_matricielle"
        >raster images</a
      >
      (i.e. determined by pixels).
    </p>

    <h2>How to include an image</h2>
    <p>In order to include an image you need:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A file with the image with the proper extension. The file can be
        anywhere on the internet, but it must be available through the http
        protocol (thus avoid Google drive or Dropbox files)
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>img</strong> tag with an src attribute with the reference to
        the image: <img src="my-image.jpg" />. The src attribute works like the
        href attribute for links: the attribute can be an absolute URL or a
        relative path.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Here is an example of the HTML5 logo that
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/logo/">has been downloaded</a> and put in
      the same directory of this page:
    </p>
    <p><img src="html5-logo.png" alt="HTML5 logo" title="HTML5 logo" /></p>
    <h2>Attributes for the image</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>img</strong> tag has many attributes, but some of them are
      considered deprecated. For instance, if the original image is not of the
      right size, in the past it was common to use the
      <strong>width="100"</strong> and <strong>height="100"</strong> attributes
      for the determining the pixels of each image. Nowadays, though, it is
      suggested to use <strong>CSS properties instead</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important attribute to use for accessibility/usability is the
      <strong>alt</strong> attribute, which should be used to describe the image
      for screen readers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img
        src="my-image.jpg"
        alt="The picture shows a
      photo of me in front of a screen"
        title="How much time do I spend in front of a screen !"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, we also use the attribute <strong>title</strong> with a descriptive
      text that shows on mouseover.
    </p>
    <h2>Basic guidelines for using images</h2>
    <p>Some advices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep in mind that big images are also heavy to download, so sometimes it
        is necessary to reduce the size of the image with an editor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be sure that there is no copyright on the image and that you respect the
        license under which the image can be used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generally, it is better to download an image instead of using its
        absolute URL
      </li>
    </ul>
