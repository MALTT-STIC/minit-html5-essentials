    <h1>Formatting Elements</h1>
    <p>
      HTML5 provide different formatting tags which, by default, have some
      formatting function, but that are rather associated to the semantic
      meaning of the text in the page.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Strong and Bold</h2>
    <p>
      The strong tag is used to mark the
      <strong>importance</strong> of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also possible to use the b tag, which is meant just to make some
      <b>text bold, without any semantic reference</b>.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
      If you see a car with license plate <b>GE 007</b> please
      <strong>contact the police</strong>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Emphasize and Italic</h2>
    <p>The em tag is used to <em>emphasize</em> a text</p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to use the i tag, which is meant just to make some
      text <i>italic</i>, without any semantic reference.
    </p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p><i>Bonjour</i> is the <em>sexiest</em> greeting ever existed!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The mark tag is used to highlight a part of text.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>
      <mark
        >HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content
        on the World Wide Web</mark
      >. It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the World Wide
      Web Consortium (W3C).This is the fifth revision of the HTML standard since
      the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous version, HTML 4, was
      standardized in 1997.

    <h2>Subscript and Superscript</h2>
    <p>
      It is possible to add sub- and super-script to text with the sub and sup
      tags.

      <del>deleted</del>.
