      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        TECFA is an academic unit in the field of educational technology,
        belonging to the School of Psychology and Education - University of
        Geneva
      </p>
      <p>
        TECFA is a research and teaching unit created in 1989 by the Facult√© de
        Psychologie et des Sciences de l'Education ("School of Psychology and
        Education") of the University of Geneva. It is active in the field of
        educational technology. TECFA's research covers a large area of
        interests, including: cognitive issues in learning technology,
        computer-supported collaborative learning, virtual learning
        environments, computer-mediated communication, information systems in
        education, and distance education.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since 1994, TECFA offered a master's degree in educational technology.
        Formerly delivered as "DESS en Sciences et Technologies de
        l'Apprentissage et de la Formation" (STAF) it has been reshaped in 2005
        as "Master of Science in Learning and Teaching Technologies". Since its
        creation, this degree combines presential activities (6 weeks per year)
        and web-based activities. TECFA has been a pioneer in the design of a
        virtual campus promoting a constructivist approach.
