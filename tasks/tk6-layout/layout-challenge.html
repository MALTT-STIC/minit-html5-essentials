    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      TECFA is an academic unit in the field of educational technology,
      belonging to the School of Psychology and Education - University of Geneva
    </p>
    <p>
      TECFA is a research and teaching unit created in 1989 by the Faculté de
      Psychologie et des Sciences de l'Education ("School of Psychology and
      Education") of the University of Geneva. It is active in the field of
      educational technology. TECFA's research covers a large area of interests,
      including: cognitive issues in learning technology, computer-supported
      collaborative learning, virtual learning environments, computer-mediated
      communication, information systems in education, and distance education.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since 1994, TECFA offered a master's degree in educational technology.
      Formerly delivered as "DESS en Sciences et Technologies de l'Apprentissage
      et de la Formation" (STAF) it has been reshaped in 2005 as "Master of
      Science in Learning and Teaching Technologies". Since its creation, this
      degree combines presential activities (6 weeks per year) and web-based
      activities. TECFA has been a pioneer in the design of a virtual campus
      promoting a constructivist approach.
