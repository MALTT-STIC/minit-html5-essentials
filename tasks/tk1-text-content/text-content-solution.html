    <h1>HTML5</h1>
    <p>The text below is taken from the HTML5 page on Wikipedia</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on
      the World Wide Web. It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by
      the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This is the fifth revision of the
      HTML standard since the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous
      version, HTML 4, was standardized in 1997.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work
      on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated
      since 2000, and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future
      developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working
      Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it. W3C and WHATWG are
      currently working together on the development of HTML5.

    <p>
      While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two
      technologies are very different. Both include features for playing audio
      and video within web pages, and for using Scalable Vector Graphics.
      However, HTML5 on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity â€“
      it must be supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash
      capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML5. See Comparison of
      HTML5 and Flash.

    <p>
      Although HTML5 has been well known among web developers for years, its
      interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media around April
      2010 after Apple Inc's then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled
      "Thoughts on Flash" where he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary
      to watch video or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open
      standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win". This
      sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that, while HTML5
      provides enhanced functionality, developers must consider the varying
      browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other
      functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash. In early November 2011,
      Adobe announced that it would discontinue development of Flash for mobile
      devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5.

    <h2>New APIs</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to specifying markup, HTML5 specifies scripting application
      programming interfaces (APIs) that can be used with JavaScript. Existing
      document object model (DOM) interfaces are extended and de facto features
      documented. There are also new APIs, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Canvas</li>
      <li>Timed Media Playback</li>
      <li>Offline</li>
      <li>Editable content</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
